    "Covariance and correlation are both measures of the relationship between two variables, but they differ in a few key ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Covariance measures the extent to which two variables vary together, whereas correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Range of values: Covariance can take on any value, positive, negative or zero, depending on the relationship between the two variables. Correlation, on the other hand, ranges from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation), with 0 indicating no correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit of measurement: Covariance is expressed in the units of the two variables being measured, whereas correlation is unitless, since it is a standardized measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: Correlation is more useful than covariance for interpreting the relationship between two variables, since it is not affected by differences in scale or units of measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, covariance and correlation are both useful measures for understanding the relationship between two variables, but correlation is generally preferred since it provides a standardized measure of the strength and direction of the relationship that is not influenced by differences in scale or units of measurement."
